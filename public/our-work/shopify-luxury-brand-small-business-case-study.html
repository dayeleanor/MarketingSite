										<h1>Netting Conversions For A New Ecommerce Brand</h1>
									</header>
									
							 
									<p>Discover how Competitive Insight helped a new eCommerce brand net scores of first-page rankings and win organic traffic in direct competition with established competitors as large as eBay and Etsy in our latest case study.</p>
 
 
<strong>Introduction</strong>
 
 
<p>When a newly created eCommerce website operating in the jewellery and luxury goods niche needed to rapidly increase its organic traffic, Competitive Insight was brought in to develop a paid shopping strategy, content calendar, keyword targets and manage overall marketing activity.</p>
 
<p>Competitive Insight also played a vital role in both product selection (by mapping product demand based upon keyword research), historical research and documentation discovery behind rare pieces as well as technical SEO optimisation for the website. These latter insights had to be made in whilst keeping Shopify’s unique website structure in mind.</p>
 
 
<strong>Small Budgets, Huge Results</strong>
 
<p>As this eCommerce brand was fully bootstrapped the large majority of their marketing spend was for the expertise of Competitive Insight’s research and outreach capabilities. Whilst initial placements and PPC campaigns were successful, we worked with the business’s co-founders to work towards a goal of long term sustainable organic traffic.</p>
 
<p>Competitive Insight was able to build the majority of links, run competitions and generate press coverage from the likes of the Financial Times based upon existing contacts, honed outreach techniques and intelligent opportunity discovery through press outlet networks.</p>
 
<strong>How Is Competitive Insight Different To Other eCommerce Agencies?</strong>
 
<p>We are experienced with managing eCommerce growth campaigns build on both Magento and Shopify and have had shown radical success with minimal marketing budgets. Our primary focus is on netting our clients sustainable organic traffic that scales alongside your business’s goals.</p>
